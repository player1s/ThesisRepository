The experiment:

	In this task partcipants are required to sort the presented stimuli based on tone. 

	Participants have to press 's' when 1000 Hz tone is presented and press 't' when a 1200 Hz tone is presented. 

	To change the number of trials -> click on the loop "trials" and change the number of nReps $.


	Analysing your data:

		Data is stored in the excel file produced by PsychoPy in the data folder. 
		- response.corr column includes data from practice trials and experimental trials. 
		Practice and experimental trials are separated by row saying "space" under key_resp_2.keys column.
		1 represents correct response and 0 reperesents incorrect response. response.rt columns shows reaction times for each trial.
